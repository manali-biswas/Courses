# My Courses

This is a React web app for keeping track of the online courses I have studied so far and the projects made.

## Description

This is my first React application with different routes.\
It uses json server to serve the details about courses, forms and other information.

### Usage

* Clone the repo
* Set up a json-server to serve 'courses', 'projects' and 'feedback' as json objects.
* Serve the objects with domain 'http://localhost:3001'
* Run 'npm start'
